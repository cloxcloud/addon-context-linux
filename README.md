# addon-context-linux-lxd

This is a fork of OpenNebula's addon-context-linux. Due to the new contextualization requirements (qemu-guest-agent and openvm-tools) which are not required by LXD and are not available for the ARM architecture used in CloX. We decided to create a new contextualization package for LXDoNe, this will simplify the setup process and provide cleaner virtual appliances. This fork will follow upstream addon-context-linux in its development process.
